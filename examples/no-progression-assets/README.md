## Installation

-   Create a `resources/bin/flags` directory in `~/InfiniteMITM`.
-   Download and move [`multiplayer-only.bin`](./resources/bin/flags/multiplayer-only.bin) into the `flags` directory.
-   Copy and paste the content of `mitm.yaml` into your own file, adapting it to your current configuration.

## Notice

Various elements, such as the store, available credits, and challenges, may be disabled. However, this won't impact your in-game progression or your ability to earn XP, CR, and SP.
