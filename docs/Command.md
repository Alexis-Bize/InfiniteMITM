# Command

**InfiniteMITM 0.3.0** has introduced `cmd` support in its `mitm.yaml` configuration for `request` and `response`. This feature allows the execution of a custom command (such as a script) before running the defined handler. Although primarily intended for advanced developers, this option is mainly designed to facilitate the use of **InfiniteVariantTool**. This tool packs XML files into binary format (bond format) and vice versa, before they are submitted by the client or received by the game.

For more information about **InfiniteVariantTool**, please visit their official [GitHub repository](https://github.com/soupstream/InfiniteVariantTool).

## Before

In the following example, the `before.cmd` command will pack an existing XML file (previously unpacked using **InfiniteVariantTool**) into a binary format before returning it to the game. Please note that **InfiniteVariantTool** must be downloaded beforehand.

```yaml
domains:
  # blobs-infiniteugc.svc.halowaypoint.com
  blobs:
    - path: /ugcstorage/enginegamevariant/:guid/:guid/:egv-bin
      methods:
        - GET
      response:
        before:
          # Run InfiniteVariantToolCLI.exe to pack and output the file
          cmd: ":mitm-dir/tools/InfiniteVariantToolCLI/InfiniteVariantToolCLI.exe bond pack :mitm-dir/resources/ugc/enginegamevariants/FFA-MITM.xml --output :mitm-dir/resources/ugc/enginegamevariants/FFA-MITM.bin"
        # Output file generated by InfiniteVariantToolCLI.exe
        body: :mitm-dir/resources/ugc/enginegamevariants/FFA-MITM.bin
```
